    The purpose of this project is to show and analyze how weather changes with respect to changes in latitude, with a special focus on how temperature changes as we get closer to the equator.  This project pulled data using an API from OpenWeatherMap in order to assemble a set of data on over 500 cities.
    After the data set was set up, matplotlib was further used to plot various relationships between weather and latitude. In addition to temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and wind were also used. This website provides the visualizations as well as the source data created as part of the analysis, and so shows descriptions and explanations of trends and correlations observed, too.
