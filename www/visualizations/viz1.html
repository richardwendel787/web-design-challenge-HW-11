        In This “City vs Max Temperature (01/05/07)” plot, we can see that, when observing the plot from left to right, 
        as the latitude moves from a negative value and gets closer to 0, the average temperature increases. At 0, it is 
        at its max, and when the latitude starts to move into the positive numbers, the average temperature of the cities 
        goes down, once again.  This explains the “n” like shape that we see here. Also notice that the entire graph has 
        a 2nd derivative concave down structure. So, the rate at which temperature cools and warms with respect to position 
        on a sphere is non-linear.
