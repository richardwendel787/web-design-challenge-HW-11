    <h1>City Latitude vs Humidity </h1>
    <div class="topnav">
    <div>
        In this graph, we can see that latitude, the independent variable, does not strongly affect the humidity, 
        the dependent variable. In other words, humidity will exist in similar measured quantities regardless of 
        how far north or south the position lies from the equator. We can also observe that humidity can exist at 
        its strongest, 100%, at higher frequencies than lower amounts of humidity. The rate at which humidity 
        increases can be measured by counting the number of dots in each row of humidity measured, the 
        “horizontal bars” from 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100. The rate at which humidity increases 
        its number of times measured, or frequency of occurrences, from smaller values to larger values is 
        increasing, concave up.
