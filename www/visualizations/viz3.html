    <h1>City Latitude vs Cloudiness </h1>
    <div class="topnav">
    <div>
      When city latitude is compared to cloudiness, we can observe that there tends to be more clouds 
      in the northern hemisphere (positive latitude) than the southern hemisphere (negative latitude).  
      Also, we can observe that some “common” cloudiness measurements are 0%, or no clouds, around 78% 
      cloudiness, and 95% cloudiness, somewhat irrespective of the north-south latitude position, yet, 
      again, was slightly more cloudy in the north.
